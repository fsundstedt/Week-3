        <h1>The Declarations of Frank</h1>
        <aside>Declarations of Frank about topics relevant to our daily lives.</aside>
        <h2>Article I: Animals</h2>
        <h3>Sec.a: Small Dogs</h3>
        <p>While it is widely accepted that canines of comparable size to an iPhone are referred to as "dogs," these Declarations hereby propose an alternative moniker: accessories. If it fits in your purse, or can fit in a normal-sized purse, that's an accessory.</p>
        <h3>Sec.b: Cats</h3>
        <p>Given our extensive research on the behavioral attributes of felines, we have reached the conclusion that their sentience is far more advanced than previously acknowledged. By examining various instances of cats interacting with cups on a ledge of any sort, we now know that not only are cats able to recognize that we humans have emotions, but that they also get a kick out of exploiting them</p>
        <h3>Sec.c: Internet Trolls</h3>
        <p>Just cats using the internet when we aren't looking. See Article I Sec.b. What else is capable of being such a toxic bastard?</p>
        <h2>Article II: Pop Culture and Media</h2>
        <h3>Sec.a: Sitcoms</h3>
        <p>These articles do find and declare that if your show needs a laughing track to tell me when it's funny, then it's not funny enough to begin with. That includes Friends and How I Met Your Mother.</p>
        <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
        <p>Sec.a does not include programs filmed in front of a live audience, provided that the reactions are live and genuine.</p>
        <h3>Sec.b: Superhero Movies</h3>
        <p>Givin the sheer number and unoriginality of recent superhero movies, they are declared to be officially of no artistic value, and their sole purpose is in fulfilling of a company's profit-generating obligation to its shareholders.</p>
        <h3>Sec.c: News</h3>
        <p>This declaration does not comment on the validity on the political leanings of various news sources; rather, it moves to declare that if your news source also tells you what M&M color you most closely identify with, you are most likely an uninformed person.</p>
        <h2>Article III: Food and Beverages</h2>
        <h3>Sec.a: Hotdog Condiments</h3>
        <p>If you are upset at the thought or sight of ketchup on a hotdog, you are either a child or a poorly-developed adult. In either case, your parents will be held responsible for letting you think your opinion dictates the tastebuds of others</p>
        <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
        <p>These declarations personally endorse mustard, mayonnaise, hot sauce, chili, and a number of other condiments for hotdog application.</p>
        <h3>Sec.b: Pineapple on Pizza</h3>
        <p>The sentiment and conclusion of Article III Sec.a is echoed for this section regarding pineapple.</p>
        <h3>Sec.c: The Butterfly Pea Flower</h3>
        <p>The butterfly pea flower is declared to be awesome and if you are tired of hearing me speak of it then you are simply unaware of it's super-cool properties, in which case further reading on your part is prescribed.</p>
        <h3>Sec.d: Fruity Cocktails</h3>
        <p>Whereas certain individuals deem themselves the proper authority to deem my consumption of a Cosmopolitan (or any fruit-centered beverage) to be excessively feminine, this authority is determined to be null and void.</p>
        <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
        <p>The aforementioned authority is deemed valid if and only if said individual is purchasing the drinks.</p>
        <h3>Sec.e: French Words on Menus</h3>
        <p>These declarations find that French words on a menu exist for the sole purpose of embarrassing the average American patron who cannot pronounce said words. This serves as entertainment for wait staff and as an emotional outlet, given their occupational requirement to deal patiently with bitching customers.</p>
